### 🕰️ Historical context: how chaos was discovered by accident

In the winter of 1961, Edward Lorenz was running a primitive numerical weather model on the
Royal McBee LGP-30 computer at MIT.  He wanted to re-examine a particular simulation from the
middle, so instead of restarting from the beginning he typed in the intermediate values
from a printout — but he entered them rounded to three decimal places (0.506) instead of
the full six-digit precision (0.506127) stored in the computer's memory.

He expected the two runs to agree.  Instead, after a few simulated weeks, the two
solutions had **diverged completely** — not just a small discrepancy, but an entirely
different weather pattern.  At first he suspected a hardware fault.  Then the insight
hit: the tiny rounding error — about one part in a thousand — had grown exponentially
until it erased all predictive information.

> *"At this point I became rather excited.  It no longer seemed that predicting
> the weather for two weeks or a month would merely be a question of developing
> better equations."*
> — Edward Lorenz, *The Essence of Chaos* (1993)

This accidental discovery led directly to the 1963 paper that founded the mathematical
study of chaos.  The three-equation model in that paper was a deliberate simplification
of the full convection equations — a toy designed to be analytically tractable — but
it captured the essential unpredictability of the real atmosphere.

**The "butterfly effect" name** came a decade later.  At the December 1972 meeting of
the American Meteorological Society, Lorenz delivered a talk titled:

> *"Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?"*

The title was chosen half-jokingly by the session organiser Philip Merilees, not by
Lorenz himself.  Lorenz used it to sharpen a point he had been making since 1963:
in a chaotic system, an *arbitrarily small* perturbation anywhere — even one too small
to measure — can, in principle, alter the large-scale evolution weeks later.
This is **not** a statement that butterflies literally cause tornadoes.
It is a statement about the *fundamental structure of deterministic predictability limits*.

## 1 · The Lorenz (1963) System

In 1963 Edward Lorenz published a three-variable model of **Rayleigh–Bénard convection** —
the buoyancy-driven overturning of a fluid heated from below.
Despite its simplicity, it became the founding example of *deterministic chaos*.

### The governing equations

$$\frac{dX}{dt} = \sigma\,(Y - X)$$
$$\frac{dY}{dt} = X\,(\rho - Z) - Y$$
$$\frac{dZ}{dt} = X\,Y - \beta\,Z$$

**What the variables represent:**

| Variable | Physical meaning |
|----------|-----------------|
| $X$ | Intensity of the convective overturning circulation |
| $Y$ | Temperature difference between ascending and descending fluid |
| $Z$ | Deviation of the vertical temperature profile from linearity |

**Classic parameter values** that produce chaotic behaviour:

| Parameter | Value | Physical role |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| $\sigma = 10$ | Prandtl number — ratio of momentum to thermal diffusivity |
| $\rho = 28$ | Normalised Rayleigh number — strength of thermal forcing relative to dissipation |
| $\beta = 8/3$ | Geometric factor — aspect ratio of convection cells |

### Fixed points and the route to chaos

The system has **three fixed points** (where all derivatives are zero):

- **Origin** $(0, 0, 0)$: the purely conductive state (no convection).
  Always exists; unstable for $\rho > 1$.
- **Two symmetric points** $C^\pm = (\pm\sqrt{\beta(\rho-1)},\; \pm\sqrt{\beta(\rho-1)},\; \rho-1)$:
  steady convective rolls.  These become **unstable** (Hopf bifurcation) when $\rho > \rho_H \approx 24.74$.

At $\rho = 28 > 24.74$, *none* of the three fixed points is stable.
Trajectories cannot settle anywhere — they must wander forever, tracing out the **strange attractor**.

### The strange attractor

For these parameters the system is *chaotic*: trajectories are **bounded** (they
stay on the attractor forever) but **never periodic** (they never exactly repeat).
The geometric object they trace out is called a **strange attractor** — a fractal set
with non-integer dimension (~2.06).

The figure below shows 70 MTU of trajectory after transients have decayed.
The colour encodes $Z$ — notice how the trajectory alternates between the two lobes
(the "butterfly wings"), corresponding to opposite senses of convective overturning.
The number of loops on each lobe before switching is *unpredictable* — that is the chaotic signature.

Trajectories wind around the two lobes in an order that looks random but is in fact

### 📐 Quantifying chaos: the Lyapunov exponent

Before the interactive demonstration, let's build intuition about how we *measure* chaos.

**The key question:** If two trajectories start with separation $\delta_0$, how fast does it grow?

In a chaotic system, the answer (averaged over the attractor) is **exponentially**:

$$\delta(t) \approx \delta_0 \, e^{\lambda t}$$

where $\lambda$ is the **leading Lyapunov exponent**.  Its sign determines the system type:

| Sign of $\lambda$ | System type | Example |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| $\lambda < 0$ | Stable fixed point or limit cycle | Damped pendulum |
| $\lambda = 0$ | Marginally stable | Integrable Hamiltonian |
| $\lambda > 0$ | **Chaotic** — exponential divergence | Lorenz 63, real atmosphere |

**The Lorenz 63 Lyapunov spectrum** $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)$:

| Exponent | Value (MTU⁻¹) | Meaning |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| $\lambda_1$ | ≈ +0.906 | Exponential stretching — the source of chaos |
| $\lambda_2$ | ≈ 0.000 | Neutral — along the flow direction |
| $\lambda_3$ | ≈ −14.57 | Strong contraction — the attractor has zero volume |

The sum $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 \approx -13.67$ is the **divergence** of the vector
field, confirming the system is dissipative (volume-shrinking).

The **Kaplan–Yorke dimension** estimates the fractal dimension of the attractor:
$$D_{KY} = 2 + \frac{\lambda_1}{|\lambda_3|} = 2 + \frac{0.906}{14.57} \approx 2.062$$

This non-integer value (between a surface and a volume) is the hallmark of a fractal strange attractor.

**The Lyapunov time** $\tau_\lambda = 1/\lambda_1 \approx 1.1$ MTU is the e-folding time for error growth.
Taking logarithms of the growth equation:
$$\ln\delta(t) \approx \ln\delta_0 + \lambda\,t$$
This is a **straight line on a log-scale plot** of separation vs. time, with slope $\lambda$.
That is exactly what the right-hand panel of Section 2 shows.

## 2 · Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions

The defining signature of chaos is that two trajectories starting from
**arbitrarily close** initial conditions diverge exponentially fast.
This is *sensitive dependence on initial conditions* (SDIC) — the butterfly effect.

### What the two panels show

| Left panel | Right panel |
|------------|-------------|
| Both trajectories in 3-D phase space | Separation $\|\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}\|$ vs time on a **log scale** |
| Green dot = shared start; coloured squares = positions at lead time $T$ | Straight line on log scale = exponential growth |
| Overlapping paths = predictable; separated paths = not | Orange dotted line = fitted $e^{\lambda t}$ slope |
| Grey cloud = full attractor (for reference) | Dashed red line = attractor diameter (no skill beyond this) |

### How to read the log-separation plot

- **Flat or slowly rising**: error growing, but sub-exponentially (very early phase).
- **Straight line (exponential phase)**: error doubling every $\ln 2/\lambda \approx 0.8$ MTU — classic chaotic regime.
- **Levelling off at the red dashed line**: error saturated.  The two forecasts are now statistically
  independent — completely uncorrelated.  Forecast skill has dropped to zero.

**🔬 Experiment — measure the Lyapunov exponent:**

1. Set lead time = **5 MTU** and δ₀ = **10⁻⁴**.  Are the blue and red paths still together?
2. Drag lead time slowly to **20 MTU**.  At what time do they separate on the 3-D plot?
   Does the right panel enter the "exponential growth" straight-line regime?
3. Reduce δ₀ to **10⁻⁶** (two decades smaller).  How many extra MTU of predictability does that buy?
   Is the gain proportional to the change in δ₀?
4. Read off λ from the slope of the orange dotted line.  Compare to the theoretical value ≈ 0.9 MTU⁻¹.

### Why this matters for weather forecasting

In the real atmosphere the leading Lyapunov exponent is $\lambda \approx 0.35\;\text{day}^{-1}$,
giving an error **doubling time** of

$$\tau_{2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda} \approx \frac{0.69}{0.35\;\text{day}^{-1}} \approx 2\;\text{days}$$

This means that even a perfect 1-hour analysis error doubles in two days.
A 10-day forecast must survive five doublings — an amplification factor of $2^5 = 32$.
No conceivable improvement in observations or models can eliminate this growth,
because it is a property of the underlying flow, not of our instruments.

**The practical predictability ceiling** in the real atmosphere is approximately
**2–3 weeks** — beyond which even a perfect initial state cannot yield a useful
deterministic forecast.  This is a mathematical consequence of the Lorenz time of the atmosphere,
not a pessimistic statement about the current state of NWP.

### 🕰️ The operational history of ensemble forecasting

The mathematical case for ensemble NWP was made long before it was computationally feasible:

| Year | Development |
|------|------------|
| **1963** | Lorenz shows deterministic chaos implies finite predictability |
| **1965** | Lorenz estimates the atmospheric predictability limit |
| **1969** | **Epstein** proposes stochastic-dynamic forecasting — the first ensemble concept |
| **1974** | **Leith** demonstrates Monte Carlo ensemble forecasting in a simple model |
| **1992** | ECMWF launches the **Ensemble Prediction System (EPS)** operationally |
| **1992** | NCEP launches the **Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)** |
| **2002** | Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) applied to NWP by Hamill & Snyder |
| **2010s** | Hybrid ensemble-variational (En-Var) data assimilation adopted by major centres |
| **2020s** | Machine-learning ensemble post-processing and diffusion-model ensemble generation |

**How are operational perturbations chosen?**

Simply adding random noise (as we do below) is not optimal — it wastes ensemble members
on directions that do not grow.  Real NWP centres use more sophisticated methods:

| Method | Idea | Used by |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Bred vectors** | Evolve a perturbation for a short time, rescale, repeat — breeds fast-growing modes | NCEP (1992–) |
| **Singular vectors** | Find the perturbation that grows most over a chosen optimisation period | ECMWF (1992–) |
| **Ensemble Kalman filter** | Use the ensemble itself as the background-error covariance in data assimilation | Many regional centres |
| **Stochastic physics** | Add random noise to model tendencies to represent model uncertainty | ECMWF (2009–) |

**ECMWF EPS at a glance (2024):** 51 members (1 control + 50 perturbed),
18 km horizontal resolution, 137 vertical levels, 15-day medium-range and 46-day extended-range products.

## 3 · Ensemble Forecasting

A single deterministic forecast is an *answer without an error bar*.
The operational response to SDIC is the **ensemble forecast**: integrate $N$ slightly
different trajectories from initial states that sample the analysis uncertainty.

### What the ensemble tells us

The **ensemble mean** $\bar X(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i(t)$ is a better
point forecast than any single member.

The **ensemble spread** — the RMS standard deviation across members — measures forecast uncertainty:

$$\sigma_\text{spread}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left|X_i(t) - \bar X(t)\right|^2}$$

Three predictability regimes:

| Regime | Spread / attractor size | Interpretation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| 🟢 **Predictable** | < 10 % | Members closely clustered; deterministic forecast reliable |
| 🟠 **Semi-predictable** | 10 – 90 % | Spread growing fast; probabilistic guidance still useful |
| 🔴 **Unpredictable** | > 90 % | Spread saturated; forecast no better than climatology |

### What the two panels show

**Left (phase space):** The green cloud is the ensemble at $t = 0$.
The red cloud is the ensemble at $t = T$.  A compact red cloud = reliable forecast.
A red cloud spanning the whole attractor = no forecast skill.

**Right (spread plot):** The blue curve is $\sigma_\text{spread}(t)$ on a log scale.
The x-position of the 🟢→🟠 transition is the **predictability horizon**.

### Why starting location matters

The attractor is not uniformly chaotic.  Near **lobe centres**, trajectories loop
coherently before switching — relatively predictable.  Near the **saddle point** at
the origin, perturbations grow much faster.  Near **lobe transitions**, which lobe
a trajectory switches to becomes sensitive to tiny perturbations.
This *flow-dependent predictability* is why modern NWP generates a fresh ensemble every 6 hours.

### Ensemble spread vs. ensemble mean error

A perfectly calibrated ensemble satisfies:
$$\langle \sigma^2_\text{spread} \rangle = \langle \epsilon^2_\text{mean} \rangle$$

where $\epsilon_\text{mean} = |\bar X - X_\text{truth}|$ is the ensemble-mean error.
In practice, most NWP ensembles are **underdispersive** (spread < error) because:

1. Initial perturbations do not fully sample the true analysis error
2. Model error is not fully represented
3. Ensemble size $N$ is finite

Underdispersion means the ensemble is **overconfident**.
Calibration techniques (inflation, rank histogram adjustment) correct for this in post-processing.

## 4 · Connection to the Real Atmosphere

The Lorenz model is a toy, but its key numbers map onto the real atmosphere
with surprising fidelity.

### Lyapunov numbers: model vs. atmosphere

| Quantity | Lorenz 63 | Real atmosphere |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Leading Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ | ≈ 0.9 MTU⁻¹ | ≈ 0.35 day⁻¹ |
| Error doubling time $\ln 2 / \lambda$ | ≈ 0.8 MTU | ≈ 2 days |
| Predictability horizon (spread > 10 %) | ≈ 3–5 MTU | ≈ 1–2 weeks |
| Full saturation | ≈ 6–9 MTU | ≈ 3–4 weeks |

With 1 MTU ≈ 5 days, ECMWF achieves useful deterministic skill to about 10 days —
roughly 2 MTU, or about 2.5 e-folding times.

### The diminishing return of better observations

Suppose you improve your analysis error from $\delta_0$ to $\delta_0 / 10$.
The extra predictable time gained is

$$\Delta t = \frac{\ln 10}{\lambda} \approx \frac{2.3}{0.35\;\text{day}^{-1}} \approx 6.5\;\text{days}$$

A factor-of-10 improvement buys only **6.5 extra days**.
A factor-of-100 improvement buys only **13 extra days**.
This logarithmic ceiling means the ≈ 2–3 week predictability limit is
**fundamental, not a consequence of inadequate technology**.

### Historical skill improvement at ECMWF

ECMWF tracks forecast skill continuously since 1980.
The 500 hPa geopotential anomaly correlation (AC) score: a score of 0.6 is
the conventional threshold for "useful" forecasting.

| Era | 500 hPa AC = 0.6 reached at... |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| 1980 | ≈ 5 days (Northern Hemisphere) |
| 1990 | ≈ 7 days |
| 2000 | ≈ 8 days |
| 2010 | ≈ 9 days |
| 2020 | ≈ 9–10 days |

The slowing rate of improvement is consistent with the **logarithmic limit** imposed by SDIC.

### Predictability of the second kind

Everything above is **predictability of the first kind**: initial-value prediction
of a specific trajectory.  There is also a **second kind**: predicting the *response
of the attractor to a sustained external forcing*.

In the Lorenz system, individual trajectories become unpredictable after ≈ 5–8 MTU,
but if you change $\rho$ (the forcing parameter), the *time-mean* of $X$ shifts
systematically — and that shift can be predicted even when individual trajectories cannot.
This is the mathematical analogue of the climate-vs-weather distinction.

| Phenomenon | Typical lead time | Mechanism |
|------------|------------------|-----------|
| El Niño / La Niña (ENSO) | 6–18 months | Slow ocean-atmosphere coupling |
| Monsoon onset | 2–4 weeks | Land–sea thermal contrast |
| Stratospheric sudden warmings | 2–3 weeks | Wave-mean-flow interaction |
| Long-term climate change | Decades–centuries | Radiative forcing from GHGs |

| Predictability type | Question asked | Chaotic limit applies? |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **1st kind** | Where will this air mass be in 10 days? | Yes — hard ceiling |
| **2nd kind** | How will the *average* temperature change if CO₂ doubles? | No — signal persists |

Climate projections are a predictability-of-the-second-kind problem.
Their uncertainty comes from *model structural error* and *scenario uncertainty*,
not from the butterfly effect.

**Key take-aways from this tutorial**

1. **Chaos is irreducible:** SDIC means that no finite improvement in initial
   conditions can extend deterministic forecast skill indefinitely.
   The atmosphere has a hard predictability ceiling near 2–3 weeks.

2. **Ensembles are the correct response:** A probabilistic forecast communicates
   the *distribution* of possible futures honestly.  A deterministic forecast
   beyond the predictability horizon is overconfident by construction.

3. **The two kinds of predictability are different problems:**
   Weather forecasting (1st kind) is limited by chaos.
   Climate projection (2nd kind) is not — but faces other sources of uncertainty.

4. **Improving observations has diminishing returns:**
   Each decade of improvement in $\delta_0$ buys only $\ln(10)/\lambda$ extra days.
   For the atmosphere that is ≈ 6.5 days per decade.

5. **Flow-dependent predictability matters:**
   Not all weather patterns are equally predictable.
   Ensemble spread is the operational estimate of this situation-dependent uncertainty.

## 📝 Guided Questions

Work through these with a neighbour (~15 min).  We will discuss as a group.

---

**Q1 — Predictability horizon** *(Section 3)*

Set δ₀ = 10⁻⁴, N = 20, starting location = *Predictable region*.
Drag lead time slowly from 1 → 30 MTU.

- At what lead time does the green start-cloud scatter across the entire attractor?
- Which colour zone does the spread plot enter at that point?
- Switch to *Chaotic lobe transition*.  Is the horizon earlier or later?
  Why might some regions of the attractor be more predictable than others?

---

**Q2 — Sensitivity to perturbation size** *(Section 3)*

Fix lead time = 15 MTU.  Slide δ₀ from 10⁻⁶ → 10⁻¹.

- Does reducing δ₀ by **one decade** give you a proportionally longer horizon?
- Using $\lambda \approx 0.9\;\text{MTU}^{-1}$, calculate the expected extra
  predictable time: $\Delta t = \ln(10)/\lambda = ?$  Does your experiment agree?
- What does this imply for the practical benefit of improving atmospheric
  observations by an order of magnitude?

---

**Q3 — Ensemble size** *(Section 3)*

Fix lead time = 15 MTU and δ₀ = 10⁻⁴.  Compare N = 5 vs N = 50.

- How noisy is the spread estimate with N = 5?
  Could you reliably identify the predictability horizon from it?
- At what N does the spread curve look smooth enough to trust?
- ECMWF uses 51 members.  Based on your experiments, does that seem justified?

---

**Q4 — Quantitative connection to the real atmosphere** *(Sections 2 & 4)*

The error e-folding time in L63 is ≈ 0.8 MTU ≈ 4 days.
ECMWF achieves useful skill to ≈ 10 days.

- How many e-folding times is a 10-day forecast?
- If ECMWF could reduce analysis error by a factor of 100, how many extra days
  of deterministic predictability would that buy?  Use $\Delta t = \ln(100) / 0.35\;\text{day}^{-1}$.
- Is this gain worth the cost of a factor-100 improvement in observations?

---

**Q5 — Predictability of the second kind** *(Section 4, bonus)*

Set starting location = *Near saddle point*, δ₀ = 10⁻⁶, N = 20.
Watch the ensemble saturate — individual trajectories become completely uncorrelated.

- Suppose you care not about any specific trajectory but about the
  **long-run time-average** of $X$.  Would that remain predictable after the Lorenz time?  Why?
- If someone changed $\rho$ from 28 to 30, could you predict the *new* time-mean of $X$
  even though individual trajectories are still chaotic?
- How does this connect to the distinction between weather forecasting
  (**predictability of the 1st kind**) and climate projection (**predictability of the 2nd kind**)?
